# React + Vite

This is the first time using Vite that I can think of. 
This is another walkthrough for a todo/checklist app. 

I am trying to do multiple checklists in a somewhat order of complexity.
while I have done one complex to do list several months earlier by ania k I will be redoing it.
I am going through this procedure of simple to complex to get a better handle on react by doing the same thing over and over again.
This in the end is practice for a big app I want to create that will incorporate a todo/checklist.
